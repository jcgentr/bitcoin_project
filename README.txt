How to compile code:
$ g++ blockchain.cpp
$ ./a.out blockchain.txt transaction.txt

The only thing I did not implement was changing the nonce to a, b, c, d, e, or f. I did not have time and did not know how to do this. 
The nonce does increment by numbers all the way up to 99999999 and a bitcoin can be mined.
